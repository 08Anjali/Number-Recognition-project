# Number Recognition Project - Data Science Internship at Bharat Intern

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Number Recognition Project, completed as Task 3 of my data science internship at Bharat Intern. This project involves developing a machine learning model to accurately recognize handwritten numbers.

# Project Overview

The Number Recognition Project is a comprehensive exploration of computer vision and machine learning techniques applied to digit recognition. The primary objectives of this project are:


# Data Preprocessing:  
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.

# Model Training: 
Implementing and training neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.

# Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics and fine-tuning parameters to enhance accuracy.
